# About Me Guessing Game

I build an app to share more about myself. It asks a few yes/no questions to let the user get to know me. The user input is taken via browser prompts and responses are give through alerts.

## Lab 02 User Story

1. As a user, I would like to learn about the site owner so I can get to know them better..
   - Create an About Me guessing game that utilizes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
   - Include on your HTML page a short biography, your education history, an overview of your job experience, and any goals that you may have.
   - Prompt the user a total of exactly five yes or no questions. The user input for the answer must accept either y/n or yes/no responses while taking into consideration case sensitivity by normalizing the user input so that it can be validated (hint: look into the .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() functions). Be sure to let the user know if they answered the question correctly by alerting them with a response.
   - Add console.log() messages within your app to notify the user if they are correct. Before submitting, comment out (don’t delete) your console.log() messages and replace them with the alerts() to complete the project.
2. As a user, I would like a personalized welcome message so that I feel like I am interacting with the site owner.
   - Ask the user their name through a prompt()
   - Display that name back to the user through a custom greeting welcoming them to your site.
   - Display the user’s name back to them in your final message to the user.

## Lab 03 User Story

1. As a user, I would like to view a series of data related to the site owners interest so that the I can quickly view more information about them.
   - Create a “Top Ten” at the bottom of your HTML page as an ordered list in HTML. Some ideas that you can include could be top ten movies, top ten favorite places, or top ten places to visit. You may choose to do whatever top ten list that you wish.
   - Convert your work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML
2. As a user, I would like to be guided to an answer through a series of feedback responses so that I can learn more about the site owner.
   - Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
   - Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
   - It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
   - After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.
3. As a user, I would like to guess the answer to a question that could have many possibilities so that I can have fun with with a guessing game.
   - Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
   - Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
   - The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
   - Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
   - Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.
4. As a user, I would like to know my final score so that I can know how well I did.
   - Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.

## Lab 04 Pair Programming 
I was paired with Ben Mills. Ben was the navigator and I was the driver during our session. I aided Ben with refactoring switch statements into functions. This reduced the overall code block and allowed Ben to better organize the overall JavaScript file. Ben was fantastic to work with!
